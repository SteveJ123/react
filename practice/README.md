### Project Background

The global pet care market size was valued at 150 billion USD in 2021 and is projected to reach 230 billion by 2030. Currently, the US market represents roughly 80% (123 billion USD) of this market; as pet ownership in other countries increases in popularity, we anticipate opportunities to capitalize on this  

The US market size for animal rescue shelters alone was $2.6 billion in 2022 and a staggering amount of $123 billion was spent on pets alone in 2022 and the global industryâ€™s worth is $150 billion. These abovementioned numbers truly show how much the industry's worth has increased over the years with an average of 1.1% per year on average between 2017 and 2022 for the US alone and counting. Our team is particularly interested in the interaction that goes on between both the adopter and animal shelter, as we believe that our system can further enhance such interactions and better able to provide more information and services to help facilitate the animal services. 

On average, people spend around 2.5 hours on social media, where they watch and interact with different content and users such as pet-based profiles where shelters post content on the process of taking abandoned pets to the shelters, taking care of them, and share the pets that have been adopted by families or individuals. This process of adopting is usually difficult and drawn-out because of communication between the individual and the shelter that is usually done through social media or the shelter personal website which is usually not performing as well as it was built.
